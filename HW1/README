###Linear Regression Models

Overview

This repository contains linear regression models developed using sampregdata.csv. The models were built following MLOps best practices, ensuring proper data organization, version control, and iterative improvements. The first model is trained using a single best feature, while the second model utilizes two highly correlated features to enhance predictive performance. Both models follow a structured approach with clear versioning to support model tracking and comparison.

Model Comparison

The first model is designed to be simple and interpretable, leveraging only the strongest single predictor for y. However, the second model incorporates an additional feature, resulting in improved performance and a lower Mean Squared Error (MSE). This demonstrates the trade-off between model complexity and accuracy. By maintaining version control, both models remain accessible, allowing for future iterations and comparisons based on evolving data and business needs.
